/* dmf 6.14.15 
 * do_DogLCD - an in progress port of the DogLCD library 
 * to enable hardware SPI use of the Electronic Assembly 
 * DOGM displays with the Particle Core and Photon.
 *
 * Version 0.1
 * At this point this code has only been tested using a 
 * DOGM162W-A display (16x2 lines, 3V3, no backlight) connected 
 * to an Arduino Nano with hardware or software SPI. Works fine.
 * 
 * The Library is based on and includes much of the code from the DogLCD
 * Library written by Eberhard Fahle (https://github.com/wayoda/DogLcd) with 
 * adaptations from the dogm_7036 Library provided by ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY 
 * (http://www.lcd-module.com/support/application-note/arduino-meets-ea-dog.html) 
 * and the SparkCore-LiquidCrystalSPI Library written by BDub
 * (https://github.com/technobly/SparkCore-LiquidCrystalSPI)
 *
 * Changes include -
 * > modifications to allow hardware SPI
 * > addition of setGain to allow software setting of the
 * LCD amplification ratio (works with Contrast to determine
 * whether you see anything on the display, or see 'black boxes'.
 * > user inputs contrast and gain (if desired) over integer range 1-64 and 1-8
 * > restructuring of the initialization code to make hardware and 
 * voltage dependent parameter settings more explicit.
 * > flag to prevent hardware reset if user has added new characters (deleted
 * during the reset, otherwise).
 * > heavily commented due to being a library/hardware n00b.
