/* dmf 6.14.15
 * do_DogLCD - an in progress port of the DogLCD library
 * to enable hardware SPI use of the Electronic Assembly
 * DOGM displays with the Particle Core and Photon.
 *
 * Particle Core port
 *
 * Version 0.1.6
 * This code has only been tested using a
 * DOGM162W-A display (16x2 lines, 3V3, no backlight) 
 * connected either to an Arduino Uno (5V) with hardware or software SPI, or
 * to a Spark Core (3V3) with hardware or software SPI. Works fine. 
 *
 * The Library is based on and includes much of the code from the DogLCD
 * Library written by Eberhard Fahle (https://github.com/wayoda/DogLcd) with
 * adaptations from the dogm_7036 Library provided by ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY
 * (http://www.lcd-module.com/support/application-note/arduino-meets-ea-dog.html)
 * and the SparkCore-LiquidCrystalSPI Library written by BDub
 * (https://github.com/technobly/SparkCore-LiquidCrystalSPI)
 *
 * Changes include -
 * > modifications to allow hardware SPI
 * > addition of setGain to allow software setting of the
 * LCD amplification ratio (works with Contrast to determine
 * whether you see anything on the display, or see 'black boxes'.
 * > user inputs contrast and gain (if desired) over integer range 1-64 and 1-8
 * > restructuring of the initialization code to make hardware and
 * voltage dependent parameter settings more explicit.
 * > flag to prevent hardware reset if user has added new characters (deleted
 * during hardware reset, otherwise).
 * > heavily commented due to being a library/hardware n00b.
